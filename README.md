### Cisco ASDM for Linux by WieWaldi
> *My personal build of Cisco ASDM

[![MIT Licence](https://wiewaldi.github.io/images-n-badges/badges/licence_mit.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)

## Motivation
Cisco does not provide any usefull solution to get ASDM running on Linux.
Therefor I've build this package and a wrapper script to get ASDM working
on Linux.

## Version
The option to create releases on GitHub is pretty nice. I really do like it
since it give me easy access to all the files without git cloning the complete
repository.  

Version 0.1
